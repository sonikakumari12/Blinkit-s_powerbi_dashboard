# Blinkit Sales Power BI Dashboard

## Project Description
The **Blinkit Sales Power BI Dashboard** is a comprehensive data analytics project designed to analyze sales performance, customer satisfaction, and outlet distribution for Blinkit. The dashboard helps identify trends across locations, item types, and outlet sizes, enabling data-driven insights for operational decision-making and business strategy.

> **Note:** For demonstration purposes, a synthetic dataset was created using GPT to simulate real-world sales data. This approach allowed for prototyping and showcasing data analysis and visualization skills without using proprietary or sensitive data.

## Workflow Overview

The project follows a standard **data analytics workflow** entirely within Power BI:
[Data Collection (Synthetic Dataset)] --> [Data Cleaning & Transformation in Power BI] --> [Power BI Dashboard Development] --> [Insights & Analysis]

### Stage Details

1. **Data Collection**
   - A synthetic dataset was created using GPT to simulate real-world Blinkit sales data, including product performance, customer ratings, and outlet information.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - All data cleaning and transformation were performed within Power BI using Power Query and DAX formulas.  
   - Steps included handling missing values, formatting columns, and calculating derived metrics like total sales per item, average ratings, and item counts by outlet.

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - Built interactive visualizations in Power BI to explore:
     - Total sales across different locations and outlets  
     - Average ratings by product category  
     - Item counts by outlet size and type  
   - Added slicers and filters for dynamic analysis by location, product, or outlet type.

4. **Insights & Analysis**
   - Identify top-performing products and outlets.  
   - Analyze customer satisfaction trends.  
   - Detect patterns in outlet distribution and inventory to support strategic decisions.
